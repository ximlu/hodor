### About Deep Packet Inspection

The principle of deep packet inspection is to capture and process IP layer data, and restore it to the corresponding application layer protocol. This is also the reason why Hodor is able to capture packets far greater than other similar packet capture software. Please keep it turned on to capture more data.

At present, Hodor only handles TCP and UDP protocols. Other protocols such as ICMP and QUIC have not been implemented yet. If you find that network requests are unreachable due to the use of these protocols by certain apps, you can turn off this option.
