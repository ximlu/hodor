If you do not agree to any of the terms herein, please do not use APP.

### 1. User Rights

All versions of Hodor come with the right to use the product on up to three devices simultaneously, including both one-time purchases and subscription versions. For all purchased products, Hodor only guarantees that the functions can be used normally at the time of purchase. Any newly added functions are not guaranteed to be added to your rights.

### 2. Automatic Subscription Service Rules

#### 2.1 Payment Rules

If you subscribe to the automatic renewal service through Apple's 1D and do not actively cancel the automatic subscription service during the subscription period, Hodor will automatically deduct the next subscription fee from the balance of the Apple 1D account linked to the automatic renewal service 24 hours before the current subscription period expires (subject to the actual Apple billing rules). You should pay attention to the balance and payment status of the account. If the renewal fails due to account issues or insufficient balance, you will bear the risk and / or loss by yourself. For your convenience, Apple will notify you of the upcoming deduction before processing the payment. It is important to note that based on the nature of the automatic renewal service, if you do not explicitly cancel the automatic renewal service during the subscription period, Apple will issue a deduction instruction to the relevant parties based on your permission. Generally, any fees deducted based on this instruction will not be refunded.

#### 2.2 Hodor Pro Subscription Period:

1 year.

#### 2.3 Price Adjustments

Hodor reserves the right to adjust service prices or stop providing automatic renewal services. If Hodor intends to adjust the service price for the automatic renewal service you have subscribed to, Hodor will notify you in an appropriate manner in advance (including but not limited to website announcements, SMS, etc.). If you do not agree with the adjusted service price, you can cancel the automatic renewal service according to these rules. If you do not cancel the automatic renewal service, the subsequent fees deducted by Apple will be adjusted to the new service fee. If you cancel the automatic subscription service within 24 hours before the subscription period ends, Apple may deduct the service fee for the next subscription period based on the adjusted service fee, and then stop the automatic deduction service. After the automatic renewal service is canceled, if you resubscribe to the automatic renewal service, the service fee automatically deducted by Apple will be based on the new service fee displayed on the screen at that time.

#### 2.4 Cancellation of Automatic Subscription Services

To cancel the automatic subscription service, follow these steps: open the Apple iOS device "App Store" -> click on the Apple account profile picture in the upper right corner -> enter "Account" -> click "Subscriptions" -> select "Hodor" -> cancel the subscription.

### 3. Account

Your AppleID is the account bound to the Hodor rights. You may not use someone else's account ID to access unpaid products and services, including but not limited to Hodor Pro software subscriptions. Any loss caused by violation of this rule will be borne by you.
